# TIK-Tac-Toe With React 

[Create React App](https://elvinhatamov.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-With-React/).

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player marks spaces with an 'X', while the second player marks spaces with an 'O'. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

In addition to the basic game play, this app also has the following features:

The winner of each game is displayed, and a message is shown if the game ends in a tie.
The app keeps track of the score for each player, and displays the score after each game.
The user can switch between ascending and descending order to view the scores.
The app uses local storage to store the scores, so the scores persist even if the user closes the app.
